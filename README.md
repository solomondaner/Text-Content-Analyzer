# Text-Content-Analyzer

Built a text content analyzer in Python to analyze input from a file and compile statistics on it. The program outputs the full text content, total word count, count of unique words, number of sentences, number of lines, the ability to find often used phrases (a phrase of 3 or more words used over 3 times), and a list of words used in order of descending frequency.
